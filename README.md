# Web-Scraping-Case-Study
In this project, we'll build a web scraper to extract job listings from a popular job search platform. We'll extract job titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, and other relevant information.

Here are the main steps we'll follow in this project:

Setup our development environment
Understand the basics of web scraping
Analyze the website structure of our job search platform
Write the Python code to extract job data from our job search platform
Save the data to a CSV file
Test our web scraper and refine our code as needed
